Now is the end of May.

I write this article to express some feelings of mine today.
Now I think I get a effective way to practice my listening and oral English.It is to see English cartoon in a special way.Initially,I need to listen a segment of cartoon without subtitles.On the second listening,I see the cartoon with subtitles and record them in the notebook.In the second listening,I will read every sentence to enhance the memory for the words as well as practice my oral English.I feel great and I can learn a lot in this way.

And this is a key I think to learn English.It is persistence.English can't be learned fast.It need long-term accumulations.So my scheme is that I need to learn English in this way every day but I needn't to spend too much time on it in a day.Such as just seeing a episode.

Another way is to practice my ability to reading.It is to see English books.For me,I need to see English physical textbook.It is a little difficult in the beginning and Now I think I am better off.
